# GraphQL Learning Project - Rick and Morty API

This project contains GraphQL queries for the Rick and Morty API to practice GraphQL concepts.

## Project Structure

### `/character`
Contains GraphQL queries for character-related operations:
- **Task 0**: Query specific characters by ID (IDs 1, 2, 3, 4)
- **Task 1**: Query paginated lists of all characters (pages 1, 2, 3, 4)

### `/episode` 
Contains GraphQL queries for episode-related operations:
- **Task 2**: Query specific episodes by ID (IDs 1, 2, 3, 4)

## API Endpoint
All queries are designed to work with the Rick and Morty GraphQL API:
`https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql`

## Usage
Each `.graphql` file contains a complete GraphQL query that can be executed against the Rick and Morty API. The corresponding `-output.json` files show the expected response structure.

## Tasks Completed
- ✅ Task 0: Get Specific Character by ID
- ✅ Task 1: Get List of All Characters (Paginated)
